                                <p>Umah Tenang was a perfect stay for our family. Beautiful grounds with multiple spaces to use. Pool was amazing and pool gazebo was the cherry on top. The staff was friendly and helped us with all our needs. Food was delicious. Just to note, nature surrounds the villa- geckos roam around the grounds and in the house but they are harmless. There are bugs around the house but itâ€™s because it is an indoor/outdoor lifestyle. The villa itself makes up for putting up with a few harmless insects and you get a true Bali experience. A wonderful experience for children to have! Each room has an en-suite making it great for multiple families and the amenities were great. We will definitely come back and highly recommend this villa!</p>

                                <p>If you are looking for absolute luxury at an amazing price DEFINITELY stay in this villa. It is absolutely HUGE and amazing from top to bottom. The pool is brilliant. The house is so well spread out so we all felt like we had our own little villa within the large villa. And the staff... so kind, generous and amazing hosts. Thank you for a wonderful week in Bali!</p>

                                <p>An ideal place for relaxing and hanging around with the family and kids, the villa is spacious and modern. Although a bit far from most places and amenities, it suited our family as we enjoy staying in mostly and just swimming, reading, going to the nearby beach or communing for a simple meal. The housekeepers and villa manager were helpful and we enjoyed our interactions with them. The villa has made our Bali trip an unforgettable one.</p>

                                <p>We had a great stay here! The house is more beautiful than shown on the pictures. The garden and the pool are bigger than an average house in Bali, which makes this an ideal and spacious place to relax! Ayu and her team were all very helpful and friendly. The communication upon arrival and during our stay was perfect, especially Wayan arranged a lot of different local excursions. If we have to say one negative thing is that the location is a bit further out of Canggu town than we had in mind, so you always have to have a scooter or car to go to town. The beach of Seseh is a 100m walk, where you can enjoy the beautiful Bali sunsets. Overall we would definitely recommend this beautiful place!</p>
